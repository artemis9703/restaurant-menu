this is my third project for Athena (also a backup if express doesnt work). its an interactive restaurant menu for a brand new diner that i have just created

i created the restaurant menu for orphues's cafe using html and css. i just learned the @keyframes and animating with css and wanted to try it out. it was a little frusterating but i think i got it :).
